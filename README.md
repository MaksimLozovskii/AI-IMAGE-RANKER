# Ticket lifecycle or how to start a ticket

Head over to the issues tab of the repository, and have a look over the tickets, when choosing a ticket, make sure to take into account the following:
- **Is the ticket complete?** The tickets with a green cicrle beside them are not yet complete
- **Can I start this ticket?** You will see a user's avatar beside the ticket if it is assigned to someone else, you cannot assign yourself to a ticket without permission if it has already been started
- **At what stage is this ticket?** There are 7 labels resembling progress at the moment: 
  - **Not started** - meaning the ticket has not yet been started and is not assigned to anyone, you can take this ticket if you want; 

  - **In development** - meaning the ticket is currently been developed by one or multiple members of the repository, you cannot work on this ticket unless the people assigned to it allow you to join;

  - **Awaiting UI review** - meaning the UI plan produced for the ticket is currently awaiting review from a senior member

  - **Awaiting code review** - meaning the code produced for the ticket is currently awaiting code review from a senior member; 

  - **Bugs present** - meaning the code that was reviewed has issues that need to be resolved in order for the code to be placed in a demo system; 

  - **Help wanted** - usually comes alongside other labels, means that the person/people assigned to this ticket is/are not able to complete the ticket on their own; 

  - **Beta testing** - meaning the ticket is currenly being tested in a controlled environemnt by other members of the repository, this is the last stage before release.

As the ticket development progresses, the ticket moves from:
**not started -> in development -> Awaiting UI review -> in development -> Awaiting code review -> beta testing -> Released and monitored**

### First steps

1) Go to the "Issues" tab and find a ticket to do, for example here is one which was just created and can be taken:
2) Click on the ticket and under the assignees tab click on your github profile, this way you will assign yourself to the ticket;
3) Under the "Labels" select the "In development" label and delete the "Not started" label. This way you will tell everyone that you have taken the ticken;

Now you can start preparing the files and the development environment;

**File structure**
CREATE a folder in a convinient place on your computer and give it the name of the ticket (ticket name is before the ": Implement Human Instruction" in the issues tab)

OPEN the folder, right click inside it and click on "Git Bash Here"
![alt text](https://github.com/MaksimLozovskii/QLabHumanProgram/blob/md-img/open-gitbash.png?raw=true)

**COMMANDS (copy and paste into git bash and press enter)**
```
git init; 
git remote add origin https://github.com/MaksimLozovskii/QLabHumanProgram; 
touch README.md;

mkdir design-files; 
cd design-files;
mkdir user-interaction-files-go-here;
mkdir visual-design-files-go-here;
cd ..;
mkdir instruction-files; 
cd instruction-files;
touch app.py;
mkdir templates;
mkdir static;
cd static;
mkdir styles;
mkdir scripts;
mkdir img;
cd ..;
cd ..;
mkdir tests-scripts; 
cd tests-scripts;
mkdir test-plan-docs-go-here;
cd ..;
```
You should have the following structure

```
📦ticket_name
 ┣ 📂design-files
 ┃ ┣ 📂User-interaction-files-go-here
 ┃ ┗ 📂Visual-design-files-go-here
 ┣ 📂instruction-files
 ┃ ┣ 📂static
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📂img
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📂scripts
 ┃ ┃ ┗ 📂styles
 ┃ ┣ 📂templates
 ┃ ┗ 📜app.py
 ┣ 📂test-scripts
 ┃ ┗ 📂test-plan-docs-go-here
 ┗ 📜README.md
```

Now, lets edit your README.md file

**Open README.md with VS code and paste this in:**
```
# Branch for "ticket name"

**Assignee - "Change to your name"**
```

Change "ticket name" to the name of the ticket you assigned yourself

Change "change to your name" to the your github nickname

# TEST TEMPLATE STRUCTURE**

**For Single Events**

if {user} |action / event| -> system should ___"

**For Multiple events**

if {user} |action / event| && |action / event | && n -> system should ___"

**For example : LOG-IN system : **

- The data that will be processed within the system:
  - User input Username
  - User input Email
  - User input Password
  
  - System stored Username
  - System stored Email
  - System stored Password
  
 - What the system should do
   - if \user\ |Presses Submit button| && |Empty String in the username field| ->  the system should output an error message "Empty Username Field not allowed"
   - if \user\ |Presses Submit button| && |Empty String in the email field| -> the system should output an error message "Empty Email Field not allowed"
   - if \user\ |Presses Submit button| && |Empty String in the password field| -> the system should output an error message "Empty Password Field not allowed"
 
   - if \user\ |Presses Submit button| && |String in Username field has incorrect format| -> the system should output an error message "Incorrect Username Format {suggest format}"
   - if \user\ |Presses Submit button| && |String in Email field has incorrect format| -> the system should output an error message "Incorrect Email Format {suggest format}"
   - if \user\ |Presses Submit button| && |String in Password field has incorrect format| -> the system should output an error message "Incorrect Passsord Format {suggest format}"
   
   - if \user\ |Presses Submit button| && |String in Username field has code| -> the system should output an error message "Incorrect Username Format {suggest format}"
   - if \user\ |Presses Submit button| && |String in Email field has code| -> the system should output an error message "Incorrect Email Format {suggest format}"
   - if \user\ |Presses Submit button| && |String in Password field has code| -> the system should output an error message "Incorrect Password Format {suggest format}"


# Submitting to github

**Create a new branch to keep your code separate from others**
```
git checkout -b "ticket_name" 
```

**For exmaple:**
```
git checkout -b ticket_name
```

![alt text](https://github.com/MaksimLozovskii/QLabHumanProgram/blob/md-img/new-branch.png?raw=true)

**Stage files before commit with:**
```
git add .
```

![alt text](https://github.com/MaksimLozovskii/QLabHumanProgram/blob/md-img/git-add.png?raw=true)

**Commit the files with:**
```
git commit -m "Type message here"
```

**For exmaple:**
```
git commit -m "New Commit"
```

![alt text](https://github.com/MaksimLozovskii/QLabHumanProgram/blob/md-img/git-commit.png?raw=true)

**Push your files to the new branch**
```
git push origin "ticket name"
```

**For exmaple:**
```
git push origin ticket_name
```
_The "ticket name" in this case will be the name of the branch_

![alt text](https://github.com/MaksimLozovskii/QLabHumanProgram/blob/md-img/git-push.png?raw=true)

**Now you can view your own branch on github under "switch branches"**

![alt text](https://github.com/MaksimLozovskii/QLabHumanProgram/blob/md-img/find-branch.png?raw=true)

**Alternatively you can find your branch under the "branches" tab**

![alt text](https://github.com/MaksimLozovskii/QLabHumanProgram/blob/md-img/your-branch.png?raw=true)

**Here is your branch**

# Planning the UI

For mocking up the UI aspect, we suggest using an application such as Figma
For the purpose of this guide, we will be using figma as its free to use.

The purpose of creating the UI portion of the application first, is to show how the user will interact with the system and how the system will behave
This way, we know exactly what should happen on the front end, if any other unexpected events happen, this will be flagged as a software issue.

{IMG}

**Event based UI creation**

To start off:


- ✅ Make the base layout using the ticket overview

{IMG}

- ✅ Copy the base layout onto a new page or a different place 2 times (so you have the before and after)
- ✅ Lay out a user-system event (where the user interacts with the system, such as presses a button and the system does something, such as prints out a message)

For example

{IMAGE BEFORE EVENT} -> {IMAGE AFTER EVENT}

- ✅ Follow the ticket objectives until all the user-system events are defined and layed out
- ✅ When you have defined and layed out all of the user-system events, export, save or just screenshot each event and save them as separate files with the name of the event, such as: "UserPressesSubmitButtonWhenFieldEmpty-SystemPrintsError", they can get long, but they give a clear indication of what is happening.
- ✅ Submit for a review

__Note that we only accept PNG or JPEG(JPG)__

# Coding up the solution

**Opening project in VsCode**

A quick way to open vs code is to right click inside your project folder, click "git bash here" and then type in

```
code .
```

This will launch vs code and open this folder as the project

# Running a development environment

**Running a development server**

To run your flask application, open gitbash inside the folder where the app.py file is, and type in the following command

```bash
FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run --port 8080
```

The website can viewed in the browser by typing in

```
localhost:8080
```

**Best coding practises**

This is what a coder's nightmare looks like 😄😄😄

![alt text](https://github.com/MaksimLozovskii/QLabHumanProgram/blob/md-img/emoji-nightmare.jpg)


Best coding practises are essential to maintain code clarity

# For Frontend
BEM - **Block Element Modifier** is a practise for naming, designing and orgranising the elements on HTML / CSS pages for better readability and scalability.

How to use BEM:
https://sparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example


# For Backend
- Name functions like you are telling them to do something:
```
✅
def getLoginDetails():
def downloadUsernameFile():
def calculateChange():
```
- Don't use symbols or undescriptive words:
```
❌
def x():                  -> Don't use letters to name functions
def ./,⍻⍻123():          -> Don't use numbers / emojis / symbols to name functions (will not work)
def download():           -> Function names should be descriptive
def DownloadUsername()    -> Functions can't start with a capital letter
```
- Create variable names to describe their content
```
✅
inputUsername = "Bob"
XaxisVal = 12
YaxisVal = XaxisVal * 2
```
- Don't use symbols or undescriptive words
```
❌
x = 123
someNumber = 456
⍻ ⍻⍻ ⍻ = "Dont-do-that-ever"
vALUEX = 123
```

# Creating your own tickets

In order to create your own ticket, you will need to put forward an idea in the idea section of out discord server, there the senior members will be able to review your ticket idea.
In order to put forward your ticket idea, create a new thread with "your username : ticket name" in the github ticket idea chat. The thread must contain the following information in bullet points: 
- Ticket overview : Gives a basic idea of what the ticket is - a feature / bug fix / feature improvement
- Who will be involved in the process apart from the reviewing team : For example if the ticket is a bug fix or feature improvement, you will have to specify the original developer of the ticket that you want to fix or improve, if you don't know who was responsible for that ticket, just put the down "creator" and the name of the ticket as they will need to grant you access and/or give information on the ticket. If the ticket is done solely by you, just put down your nickname.
- Initial design mockups (if applicable) : Could just be a rough sketch in paint - this is just to give us an overview of what this could look like
