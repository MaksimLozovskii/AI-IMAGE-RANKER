# QLab Human Program Project Onboarding
ðŸ”¥ _This is the official QLab Human program repository_ ðŸ”¥

Human program - platform / app where people can do useful work by following instructions for rewards and ranks, while at the same time achieving desired results
---
##### This concept can be applied to any kind of platform where human interaction is needed
##### Using rewards and neuro-linguistic programming techniques we "program" the unmotivated / undisciplined users where the result is what they ultimately want to achieve.
